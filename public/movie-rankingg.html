<h1>The Best Movies According to Candice</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Decision to Leave</h3>
<h4>by 박찬욱(Park Chan-wook)</h4>
<p>"Decision to Leave" is always one of the first films that comes to my mind when someone asks about my favorite works. The cinematography is visually captivating, and the story weaves seamlessly between love and suspense. Both lead actors deliver breathtaking performances, and the dialogue is rich with meaning and poetic nuance—something worth savoring slowly.</p>

<h3>Poor Things</h3>
<h4>by Γιώργος Λάνθιμος (Georgios "Yorgos" Lanthimos)</h4>
<p>I watched “Poor Things” in New York with my best friend, and first of all—the production design was absolutely stunning! As the story unfolds through different chapters, the protagonist journeys through various places and undergoes continuous growth, gradually developing a deeper sense of identity and humanity. Every costume and set piece is intricately crafted and dreamlike, perfectly matched to each moment, showcasing the magical power of cinema and art to transport us beyond reality.

    What’s more, the themes the heroine comes to understand in each chapter are genuinely thought-provoking. Through a fantastical, slightly absurd narrative, the film explores experiences and perspectives that deeply resonate with the female experience—making it both whimsical and profoundly relatable.</p>

<h3>About Time</h3>
<h4>by Richard Whalley Anthony Curtis</h4>
<p>“About Time” was the first movie I watched with my boyfriend. I’m not usually someone who’s into romance films, but this one is truly special and has a permanent place in my heart!

    I absolutely loved how the male lead is a bit awkward but so genuinely kind to the woman he loves—it’s incredibly sweet and real. Their relationship feels so full of love and authenticity, it made me feel like I was living in London with them.
    
    And the bond between the main character and his family—especially his father, with whom he shares a beautiful secret—is what makes me tear up every single time. Honestly, cherishing the people who love you most while they’re still by your side really is the most magical thing in the world.</p>
